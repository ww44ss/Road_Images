# Road_Images
This is a repo of road images for machine learning 

## Program Files
__Image_Grabber.R__ is a program which downloads an image at regular intervals from the TripCheck.org [Santiam Pass Webcam](http://tripcheck.com/RoadCams/cams/Santiam%20Pass_pid2728.JPG?rand=567)  
  
## Data Files  
Images are stored in the directory __Image\_Data__
In addition, an indexed csv catalogs the data and correlates various factors to the data (road conditions, time of day, etc.) which will ultimately be used for machine learning.
